# Algorithm4

Learning the [Princeton University Algorithms](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne.

It has two main parts:


1. The programming assignments solutions of [Coursera Algorithms, Part I ](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI), it is in Java
2. The equivalent Python implementation of the Java algorithms implemented in [algs4](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) package, and some other codes used in the lecture.

## Python implementations

### Quick Starts

Please install/update/downgrade the required packages used in this project by running `pip install -U -r requirements.txt `. Please make sure the pip in added into your system path.

And the recommended way to run TestToolBox is [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/). Currently recommended Python version would be **3.3**.

### What's included
Within the download you'll find the following directories and files. To get the tree structure, in window `CMD`, type `tree \f`.

```
